# React Query

# A library for fetching data in a React Application

# Why

# 1. Since react is a UI Library, there is no specific pattern for data fetching.

# 2. We use useEffect hook for fetching data and useState for maintaining the states.

# 3. If the data is needed throughout the application, we tend to use state management libraries.

# 4. Most of the libraries are good for client state.

# 5. State management libraries are not great with asynchronous or server state.
